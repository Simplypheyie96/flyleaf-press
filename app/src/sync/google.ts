/* Signing in to Google, and nothing more than that.

   WHY THIS IS THE SHAPE IT IS. Flyleaf Press has no server and does not want
   one — the library is local, and that is the promise. So backup does not mean
   "our database holds your reviews": it means the shelf is written into the
   user's OWN Google Drive, into a hidden folder only this app can see
   (`appDataFolder`). We never hold a copy, we never see it, and the storage it
   uses is theirs. That is the only version of sync this app could honestly
   offer, and it is also the only one that stays free.

   NO CLIENT SECRET, ANYWHERE. This is Google Identity Services' token flow,
   designed for exactly this: a browser app with no backend. The client ID is
   public by design — it is compiled into the JavaScript every visitor
   downloads, and that is fine, because a client ID is not a credential. The
   client SECRET is never used, never stored, and must never appear in this
   repo.

   THE SCOPE IS ONE LINE, AND IT MATTERS. `drive.appdata` grants access to a
   folder this app creates and nothing else: not their documents, not their
   photos, not one other file in their Drive.

   TOKENS LIVE IN MEMORY ONLY. An access token is good for about an hour and is
   never written to disk. What IS remembered is a flag saying "this device
   opted in", which lets us ask Google for a fresh token silently rather than
   putting a popup in front of somebody who already said yes. */
